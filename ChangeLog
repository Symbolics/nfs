	* nfs.cl: Lowered *statcachereaptime* from 50000 to 5.  The 50000
	was for testing.   

	* portmap.cl:  Changed the main 'cond' into a 'case'.  Implemented
	portmpap-null.  Added portmap-callit.  It doesn't do
	anything... just prints out the parameters.   As far as I can
	tell, there is no reason to implement this right now.

	* sunrpc.cl:  Added a parameter *gather* that chooses between two
	behaviors when it comes to TCP traffic.  If *gather* is t, the
	packet size plus the packet data will be combined into a single
	buffer and sent all at once.  This requires copying the the packet
	data into a new buffer which may prove to be slow.  A potential
	advantage of this is that network overhead will be reduced since
	one packet will be sent instead of one small packet (4 bytes)
	followed by a larger one.  One definite advantage of this is that
	it allows packet analyzers (like tcpdump) to read the packet
	properly. 

	* xdr.cl:  Important bug fix in xdr-opaque-variable-from-stream.
	Opaque data is supposed to be blocked to a 4-byte boundary.  I
	wasn't doing that.  Non-linux clients got very upset by this.

	* nfs.cl: Use excl::filesys-delete-file instead of delete-file so
	that I can get errno information.

2001-06-20    <dancy@SUCK>

	* fhandle.cl: Removed the ensure-* functions.  Removed any unused
	functions.  Added some type declarations to possibly speed some
	operations up.  Changed one function to a macro.

	* mountd.cl: Updated the code to use with-successful-reply.
	Removed some calls to obsolete functions in fhandle.cl.

	* mpsocketfix.cl: Added #-(version>= 6 1) conditionals since this
	fix is in 6.1.

	* nfs.cl: Added some type declarations.  Added a check or two to
	make sure certain functions were being called w/ pathnames (not
	strings).  Removed some calls to obsolete functions in fhandle.cl.
	Removed some unused functions.

	* sunrpc.cl: Added a #-(version>= 6 1) conditional around the code
	that caused the EWOULDBLOCK in 6.0.

	* xdr.cl: Added a gang of type declarations.  Fixed the syntax
	error I had in defstruct that was making my attempts at type
	declarations useless.

	
2001-06-14    <dancy@SUCK>

	* nfs.cl: Remove extra debugging output.  Added extra error
	checking to nfsd-create.

	* loadem.cl: Added 'fixes' to the load/compile list.

	* nfs.cl: Zillions of changes for optimization.  Added in a
	blocksize hack to improve 'rm -r' behavior w/ linux clients.

	* xdr.cl: removed a debugging message..  did some minor
	optimizations.

2001-06-07    <dancy@SUCK>


	* nfs.cl: Changed a zillion calls from ff:fslot-value to
	ff:fslot-value-typed.  Added a function to update file mtime,
	atime, and filesize in the statcache (used for nfsd-write).
	Cleaned up nfsd-remove.  Cleaned up nfsd-write.  

	* xdr.cl:  Changed the way xdr-opaque-fixed/variable return things
	(during extraction).
	
	* mountd.cl (mountd-make-fhstatus): Specify the size of the xdr to
	speed things up.

	* loadem.cl (startem): Run (nfsd) as a separate process now.

	* fhandle.cl (opaque-fhandle-to-pathname): New function.  
	* Many many changes that hopefully will improve performance

2001-05-23    <dancy@SUCK>

	* nfs.cl:  nfsd-getattr:  Added check for stale file handle.
	Commented out some debugging lines.

	nfsd-read: Changed call to xdr-opaque-variable to be more
	efficient (no subseq).

	* xdr.cl: Changed xdr-opaque-variable to allow for efficient
	operation.   Added a function xdr-opaque-variable-from-stream
	which isn't used yet.

2001-05-23    <layer@HOBART>

	* nfs.cl (nfsd-write): handle case of fhandle-vec-to-pathname
	returning nil

2001-05-23    <dancy@SUCK>

	* nfs.cl:  Changed a debugging message

	* sunrpc.cl: Update send-successful-reply so that it doesn't call
	rpc-send-msg (which saves an xdr-xdr call).

	* xdr.cl: Added a 'pos' slot to the xdr structure to use to avoid
	subseq calls in xdr-advance.  Updated other code to use this new
	slot.  Probably introduced a buncha bugs.

2001-05-23    <layer@HOBART>

	* extra.cl: make warning go away
	* nfs.cl: fix nfsd-remove to handle permission denied

2001-05-23  Kevin Layer  <layer@crikey>

	* many files, CRLF conversion

2001-05-22    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* fhandle.cl:  Make sure pathnames are always canonicalized before
	hashing.  Also, added a function for dumping the file handle hash
	table.

	* mountd.cl: added (in-package :user) and $Id: ChangeLog,v 1.16 2001/07/03 03:22:34 dancy Exp $

	* mpsocketfix.cl: added (in-package :user) and $Id: ChangeLog,v 1.16 2001/07/03 03:22:34 dancy Exp $

	* nfs.cl added (in-package :user) and $Id: ChangeLog,v 1.16 2001/07/03 03:22:34 dancy Exp $
	Added a function to make sure directory names end w/ a backslash.

	Increased debugging info for nfs-readdir.

	Removed readdir caching code.

	Increased debugging info for add-direntries and also attempted to
	add a workaround for what I believe is a bug in the Linux NFS v2
	client implementation w/ regard to readdir.

	* portmap.cl:  added (in-package :user) and $Id: ChangeLog,v 1.16 2001/07/03 03:22:34 dancy Exp $

	* sunrpc.cl: added (in-package :user) and $Id: ChangeLog,v 1.16 2001/07/03 03:22:34 dancy Exp $

	* utils.cl: added (in-package :user) and $Id: ChangeLog,v 1.16 2001/07/03 03:22:34 dancy Exp $
	added :strings-convert nil  to calls to def-foreign-call to remove
	warnings. 

	* xdr.cl: added (in-package :user) and $Id: ChangeLog,v 1.16 2001/07/03 03:22:34 dancy Exp $

	* nfs.cl: Send rpc PROC_UNAVAIL for procedures that we don't
	handle.  This will prevent nfs clients from wedging.

	* sunrpc.cl: Added rpc-send-proc-unavail function to send
	PROC_UNAVAIL responses.

	* Added .cvsignore

	* added nfs.txt which is the NFS V2 RFC.

	* Updated the readme to show how to edit the export list

	isn't already defined.

	* Added Makefile and ChangeLog
