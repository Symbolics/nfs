	* loadem.cl: Added 'fixes' to the load/compile list.

	* nfs.cl: Zillions of changes for optimization.  Added in a
	blocksize hack to improve 'rm -r' behavior w/ linux clients.

	* xdr.cl: removed a debugging message..  did some minor
	optimizations.

	* nfs.cl: Changed a zillion calls from ff:fslot-value to
	ff:fslot-value-typed.  Added a function to update file mtime,
	atime, and filesize in the statcache (used for nfsd-write).
	Cleaned up nfsd-remove.  Cleaned up nfsd-write.  

	* xdr.cl:  Changed the way xdr-opaque-fixed/variable return things
	(during extraction).
	
	* mountd.cl (mountd-make-fhstatus): Specify the size of the xdr to
	speed things up.

	* loadem.cl (startem): Run (nfsd) as a separate process now.

	* fhandle.cl (opaque-fhandle-to-pathname): New function.  
	* Many many changes that hopefully will improve performance

	* nfs.cl:  nfsd-getattr:  Added check for stale file handle.
	Commented out some debugging lines.

	nfsd-read: Changed call to xdr-opaque-variable to be more
	efficient (no subseq).

	* xdr.cl: Changed xdr-opaque-variable to allow for efficient
	operation.   Added a function xdr-opaque-variable-from-stream
	which isn't used yet.

	* nfs.cl (nfsd-write): handle case of fhandle-vec-to-pathname
	returning nil

2001-05-23    <dancy@SUCK>

	* nfs.cl:  Changed a debugging message

	* sunrpc.cl: Update send-successful-reply so that it doesn't call
	rpc-send-msg (which saves an xdr-xdr call).

	* xdr.cl: Added a 'pos' slot to the xdr structure to use to avoid
	subseq calls in xdr-advance.  Updated other code to use this new
	slot.  Probably introduced a buncha bugs.

2001-05-23    <layer@HOBART>

	* extra.cl: make warning go away
	* nfs.cl: fix nfsd-remove to handle permission denied

	hashing.  Also, added a function for dumping the file handle hash
	table.

	Added a function to make sure directory names end w/ a backslash.

	Increased debugging info for nfs-readdir.
