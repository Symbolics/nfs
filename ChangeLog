TODO BEFORE RELEASE (PLEASE LEAVE THIS AT TOP OF FILE)
	* loadem.cl: remove :nfs-telnet-server from *features*

*******************************************************************************
4.5b10
*******************************************************************************

2007-03-12    <layer@HOBART>

	* loadem.cl: push :nfs-telnet-server on *features*

*******************************************************************************
4.5b9
*******************************************************************************
2007-02-08    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* configure/configform.cl: rfe6786.  Exports are now displayed in
	sorted (by export name) order.

	* BUGFIX: User-defined mountd port wasn't being honored.  Fixed.

	* sunrpc-service.cl: Allow port number to be specified in
	def-rpc-program.

	* nsm.cl, nlm.cl, configure/configfirm.cl: rfe6797: Allow user to
	control nsm and nlm ports.

2007-01-25    <layer@HOBART>

	* Makefile
	* configure/Makefile: remove bogus comment, add STABLE test for
	  layer's stable lisp directory, from which the NFS product should
	  be build

*******************************************************************************
4.5b8
*******************************************************************************
2007-01-23    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* locking.cl: New file (used by nlm.cl)

	* nlm.cl: Use new functions from locking.cl to use direct Win32
	LockFile and Unlockfile APIs.  This was an attempt to fix issues with spr32573.  It didn't help, but I'll leave the changes in anyway.

	* nlm.cl: Added error handlers around my-lock-file and
	my-unlock-file calls to deal with spr32573 strangeness.  I don't
	understand why UnlockFile is failing sometimes.  The customer
	cannot reproduce w/ a small test case.  Anyway, these changes
	should keep things moving along even when UnlockFile fails (we
	simply log and ignore it).
	
*******************************************************************************
4.5b6
*******************************************************************************
2007-01-17    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* interval.cl: New file (used by nlm.cl)

	* BUGFIX: nlm.cl: Reimplemented large chunks of the locking
	process to allow for proper compatibility between unix-style and
	windows-style locking.  Hopefully this will address spr32573 and
	spr32512.

*******************************************************************************
4.5b5
*******************************************************************************
2006-12-20    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* BUGFIX: nfs.cl: Fixed many with-xxx macros so that they return
	properly formatted results for the 'link' operation (which has
	different on-fail return info than other procedures).
	
*******************************************************************************
4.5b4
*******************************************************************************
2006-12-19    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* BUGFIX: spr32469: Attempt to improve hard link support.  Added
	(really, just added enforcement of) limitation that hard links can
	only be made within the same parent directory.  

	* loadem.cl: Addef :efmacs to module list.

	* telnet.cl: Set eol-convention on new connections to :dos so that
	the Windows telnet client is usable.

*******************************************************************************
4.5b3
*******************************************************************************
2006-10-02    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* BUGFIX/INTEROPERABILITY spr32134 nfs.cl, rmdir procedure:
	excl.osi.rmdir returns a terrible error code (*einval*) when
	passed a non-directory filename so I had to add a specific check
	for non-directory rmdir calls and return the correct error code
	(*nfserr-notdir*).  Luckily this only affects very old or very
	strange NFS client implementations (like linux 2.0).

*******************************************************************************
4.5b2
*******************************************************************************
2006-09-13    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* BUGFIX: setup-logging: Enable logging regardless of setting of
	*nfs-debug*

	* BUGFIX: configure/*: "Use System Portmapper" combo box wasn't
	being populated from the config file.  Fixed.  Also added text to
	note that the setting only applies at startup.

	* BUGFIX: portmap.cl, ping-portmapper: Fixed.  Wasn't detecting
	system portmapper properly.

*******************************************************************************
4.5b1
*******************************************************************************

2006-09-06    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* ENHANCEMENT: <many files> Debug message timestamps now always include
	the date.  

	* ENHANCEMENT: configure/*: Rearranged some of the debug options.
	Added NLM and NSM debug options.  Removed timestamp-related debug
	options.

	* spr32020. ENHANCEMENT:
	attr.cl/nfs.cl/configure: New option *nfs-set-mtime-on-write*
	allows users to work around Windows' funny behavior with respect
	to file modification times.  Normally Windows does not update the
	mtime on a file until the file is closed.  Since Allegro NFS keeps
	a file open while it is actively being written-to, a Windows
	program periodically checking the mtime of the file will not be
	able to tell that the file is actually being modified until the
	file is closed.  Updating the mtime during every write access
	suffers about a 10% penality so the option is disabled by default.
	
*******************************************************************************
******** 4.4 release ***********

2006-08-24    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* nfs.nsi, "Start Menu Shortcuts" section: Delete old "Allegro NFS Server for Windows" shortcut.
	
*******************************************************************************
4.3.3b12
*******************************************************************************
2006-08-23    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>
        * Various minor tweaks to finalize NLM stuff. 
	* Attempt to squeeze out a few nanoseconds here and there.
	* BUGFIX: rename will now rename on top of an existing file.

*******************************************************************************
4.3.3b11
*******************************************************************************

2006-07-28  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
	* Bumped version.

2006-07-13    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* USABILITY: nfs.nsi: Do not add start menu shortcut to run
	Allegro NFS as a standalone app.  This was confusing users.
	Removed the option for installing as a non-service.

2006-06-22    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>
*******************************************************************************
4.3.3b10
*******************************************************************************

	* nfs-common.cl: Bumped version
	
	* main.cl: Changed some logit calls to 'format t'.  

	* servicelib.nsh: New
	
	* nfs.nsi: moved out the servicelib.nsh stuff into its own file.
	Updated servicelib.nsh to v1.3.  

	Use %WINDIR%\system32\net.exe to stop the NFS service since it
	properly waits until the service is really terminated (I emailed
	the servicelib.nsh dude asking for the addition of this behavior).
	This should remedy the problems the used to occur when people
	would reinstall or uninstall while the service was still running.

*******************************************************************************
4.3.3b9
*******************************************************************************

2006-06-13    <layer@HOBART>

	* main.cl: use gate to shutdown mainloop
	* nfs-common.cl: incf version
	* rpcgen.cl: hide windows that pop up

*******************************************************************************
4.3.3b8
*******************************************************************************

2006-05-16    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* openfile.cl: Added optimize declaration to get-open-file
	function to reduce instruction count.

2006-05-15  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* xdr.cl (et al), attempts to speed up xdr-int and friends.
	Instruction count is greatly reduced.

*******************************************************************************
4.3.3b7
*******************************************************************************
2006-05-11    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* Overhauled all the subprograms (portmap, mountd, nsm, nlm) to
	use an rpcgen-generated framework.

	* BUGFIX: [spr31587] It's not clearly stated in the spec but if
	the CREATE procedure is called on a file that already exists, it
	should report success anyway.  This is fixed now.

	* BUGFIX: create3 procedure was ignoring supplied file attributes.
	Fixed.
	
2006-05-06  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* *.cl: Changed calls to callrpc to callrpc-1.  All of these
	eventually need to be changed back to calls to callrpc, but using
	the new calling sequence.

	* portmap.cl: Moved portmap-getport-client out and into
	sunrpc.cl.  portmap.cl should be strictly for portmap service
	functions, not client functions.

	* rpcgen.cl: Fleshed out a bit more.  Generates separate files for
	common stuff, client calls, and server definitions.

	* sunrpc-common.cl: Added a few more constants.

	* sunrpc-service.cl: Revived.  Ideally sunrpc.cl will become a
	standalone file that does not have any Allegro NFS-related code in
	it.  Then it can be packaged up for general use.

	* sunrpc.cl:  Added an rpc client interface.  Imported
	portmap-getport-client from portmap.cl.  Moved some rpc service
	stuff out into sunrpc-service.cl.

	* xdr.cl:  Added xdr-optional function.  Improved xdr union macro.

*******************************************************************************
4.3.3b6
*******************************************************************************

2006-04-25    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* BUGFIX: mountd.cl, nfs.cl, portmap.cl, sunrpc.cl: Bugfix for clients
	using 64KB buffers.  

*******************************************************************************
4.3.3b5
*******************************************************************************

2006-03-24    <layer@HOBART>

	* nfs-common.cl: bump version for new demoware key

*******************************************************************************
4.3.3b4
*******************************************************************************

2006-03-14    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* *.cl: Replaced calls to (null-verf) and (nfsd-null-verf) with
	*nullverf*.  Replaced all calls to (null-auth) with *nullauth*.
	
	* ENHANCEMENT: nfs-common.cl/nfs.cl: Added support for debugging
	of individual NFS procedures.

	* nlm.cl, nsm.cl: Disable debugging by default.

	* portmap.cl: Don't log CALLIT procedure unless debugging is on.

	* ENHANCEMENT: configure/*: Moved debugging options into their own
	tab.  Added checkboxes for individual NFS procedures.

*******************************************************************************
4.3.3b3
*******************************************************************************

2006-02-01    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* ENHANCEMENT: Cleaned up mountd logging.

	* Made *eexist* error reporting less alarming.

	* ENHANCEMENT: Support EXCLUSIVE create3 mode.  Not completely to
	spec but good enough.  [spr31178]
	
*******************************************************************************
4.3.3b2
*******************************************************************************

2006-01-31    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* INTEROPERABILITY ENHANCEMENT: READDIRPLUS support.

*******************************************************************************
4.3.3b1
*******************************************************************************

2006-01-30    <layer@HOBART>

	* Makefile,
	* configure/Makefile: always ACL 8.0 to build

2006-01-30    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>
	* ENHANCEMENT: Allegro NFS now checks for an already-running
	instance when initializing.  It will abort in a noticable way if
	there is.  This will help de-obscure this semi-typical failure
	scenario.

	* ENHANCEMENT: Made some logging messages more informative and
	more consistent.

	* INTEROPERABILITY ENHANCEMENT: Portmapper now sends proper
	responses for program-unavailable or mismatched versions
	[spr31061].
	
2006-01-30  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* rfc1833.txt: New file. Defines newer versions of the portmapper
	(aka rpcbind) protocol.

2006-01-23    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* Intermediate commit for nsm/nlm support:

	fhandle.cl:  New helper: vec-to-fhandle.

	loadem.cl:  Load nsm and nlm.

	main.cl: Start nsm and nlm.

	nfs.cl: Changes due to the changes make to
	xdr-opaque-{fixed,variable} in xdr.cl

	openfile.cl: Finer grain locking.  Each openfile struct now has a
	lock.  *open-file-cache-lock* still protects the hash tables.
	openfile structs now have a reference count slot which is used by
	lockd to hold a file open until all locks are released (the open
	file reaper will not reap any file w/ a non-zero refcount).
	with-nfs-open-file accepts :any for the direction arg to access
	files that should already be open.

	sunrpc-service.cl: Removed in favor of rpcgen and macros in sunrpc.cl

	rpcgen.cl: New.  Processes a .x file and generates defconstants
	and macro calls.  I used this to generate the base code for nlm.cl.

	sunrpc.cl: New macro def-rpc-program.  Creates a function which
	opens sockets and do an RPC main loop on your behalf.  You just
	have to define the procedure functions.

	xdr.cl: Added xdr-void function.  Added xdr-unsigned as an alias
	for xdr-unsigned-int.  Added xdr-long as an alias for xdr-int.
	Added xdr-extract-vec for extracting the subseqence of a "vec" (as
	returned by xdr-opaque-{fixed,variable}).  modified
	xdr-opaque-{fixed,variable} so that they return a (vec/offset/len)
	triple instead of (xdr/offset/len) triple.  
	
2006-01-19    <dancy@GOBY>
v4.3.2
	
	* ENHANCEMENT: Added option to the configure program to enable
	portmapper debugging.  Augmented the debugging info that
	portmapper generates to include the IP address of the requestor.

2005-11-22    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>
v4.3.1

	* Makefile, configure/Makefile:  Use c:/program files/acl80 now.

	* BUGFIX: bugfix for the configure program (where the mountd port
	would change to 5000 instead of automatic, without user
	intervention).
	(spr30929, spr30924)

*******************************************************************************
******** post-4.3 release ***********

2005-10-31    <layer@HOBART>

	* nfscleanreg.vbs: delete new 4.3 key, too

*******************************************************************************
******** 4.3 release ***********

2005-10-26    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* nfs.nsi: [bug15756].  If running on a system with DEP, apply
	workarounds to the registry.

	* nfs.nsi: For the start menu start/stop service shortcuts, use
	net.exe instead of nfs.exe.
	
2005-10-20    <layer@HOBART>

	* nfs.nsi: make installer fail on win9x

2005-10-19    <dancy@CANDY2K>
v4.3
	
	* nfs.cl: [spr30771] with-same-export: Fixed error response.  It
	wasn't RFC compliant for NFSv3.

2005-10-18    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>
v4.2
	
	* mountd.cl (mountd): Add a handler-case around the call to
	mountd-message-handler. [spr30735]

2005-10-05    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>
	* dir.cl: Directory caching key is now a file handle instead of a
	path string.

	* fhandle.cl: Update fh-pathname slot of children and subchildren
	slots when renaming a filehandle. [spr30666].

	* nfs.cl: Print out some "normal" error messages (like file not
	found when doing a 'lookup') in a less alarming way.   Adjusted
	directory caching related function calls according to changes made
	in dir.cl.

2005-08-10    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

v4.1
	
	* nfs-common.cl: Moved *nfsd-version* and *nfsd-long-version*
	variables here.  Adjusted 'bailout' macro so that the console
	window is shown.  I meant to do that when I first made the macro.
 
	* Makefile: Adjusted so that it grabs the program version from
	nfs-common.cl instead of nfs.cl

	* main.cl: Wait for mountd to finish initializing before starting
	nfsd.  Print "Allegro NFS server version ~a initializing..."
	before starting up any subprograms.

	* mountd.c: Added support for user-defined port number to use for
	udp and tcp sockets.  This will make it easier on people who have
	to deal with firewalls.  Also, open *mountd-gate* once all sockets
	and stuff have been prepared and mountd is ready to operate. 

	* nfs.cl: Only log "Allegro NFS Server version ~a started." after
	all sockets have been created, etc.

	* configure/*:  Added options in the 'Global' tab so that user can
	set the port which mountd should use for its sockets. 


*******************************************************************************
post-4.0 release changes

*******************************************************************************
******** 4.0 release ***********

2005-08-09    <layer@HOBART>

	* hammernfs.c: add -q
	
	* Makefile: add -O to hammernfs build; make prereqs use same
	  branch (or trunk) for date/demoware as for nfs module
	* (NEW) cvstag.sh
	* (NEW) test.sh
	* nfs.cl: delete demoware-check call

2005-08-08  Kevin Layer  <layer@gemini>

join changes from release_3_0 branch onto trunk
The changes were solely to do demo a different way

2005-08-05    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* sunrpc-common.cl: Bump *rpc-buffer-size* to 70KB so that 64KB
	NFS read/writes will work properly.

2005-08-03    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* attr.cl/fhandle.cl/nfs.cl: hard link support, if the filesystem
	(such as NTFSv5) supports it.  It works but it could be better.
	One problem is that 'stat' on Windows doesn't return real link
	counts.  Another problem is that information about hard links is
	not preserved across server restarts.  Hard links that were not
	created via NFS during a given session are considered to be
	separate files (and, as a result, are given separate file
	handles).  Despite these issues, it'll probably be okay for
	programs that use hard links to make locks.  

	Large files are supported now (by virtue of building on a patched
	acl 7.0)

	* sunrpc-service.cl:  Extracted from sunrpc.cl.

	* loadem: Comment out nlm and nsm for the time being.

2005-07-28    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* nlm.cl: New. Network Lock Manager protocol.

	* loadem.cl: Load nsm and nlm modules.

	* sunrpc.cl: Added beginnings of a easy rpc service processor.

	* xdr.cl: Added :make-vec arg for xdr-opaque-variable.  Added some
	macros to make it easy to deal with xdr structures.

2005-07-20    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* nsm.cl: New.  

	* xdr.cl: xdr-opaque-fixed.  Adjusted API.

2005-06-28    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* portmap, mountd, nfsd:  Added handler-cases around socket
	  creation code to catch any errors and to make them apparent to
	  the user.

	* mountd.cl: Report the udp and tcp port numbers that are being
	used for mountd so folks who want to poke holes in their firewalls
	will have sufficient information on what ports to use.  A future
	release may allow the operator to specify which port number should
	be used (defaulting to auto).

2005-06-24    <dancy@CANDY2K>
4.0, rc6:
	
	* nfs.cl: Work around bugs in HP-UX NFS v3 implementation.  It
	violates NFSv3 readdir protocol (doesn't supply the cookie
	verifier on subsequent calls to readdir).

	Adjusted/ some debugging output.  

2005-06-23    <dancy@CANDY2K>
4.0, rc5:
	
	* attr.cl: Use excl::cl-internal-real-time instead of
	get-universal-time in a few places to reduce consing.

	* dir.cl: #+ignore some debugging

	* sunrpc-common.c: New.  Used to hold a constant that is used in
	both xdr.cl and sunrpc.cl
	
	* loadem.cl:  Added sunrpc-common

	* mountd.c: Don't use :reuse-address in call to make-socket.  We
	don't specify a specific local port number so it is not necessary.
	
	* nfs-common.cl: Added *nfs-debug-timestamps* parameter.

	* nfs.cl: For the time being (and maybe forever?) don't use
	:reuse-address when making sockets.  This is so that conflicts with
	other installed NFS server products will be made apparent.

	Added support for timestamping on some of the debugging output.

	* portmap.cl: Don't use :reuse-address when making the sockets.
	This is to make conflicts more apparent.

	* sunrpc.cl:  Moved *rpc-buffer-size* constant to sunrpc-common.cl.  

	Use #. before all uses of *rpc-buffer-size* so that dynamic extent
	arrays can be optimized.

	* configure/*: Added checkbox for timestamping debugging output.

2005-06-22    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* fhandle.cl: Removed some type checks for production.  Changed
	xdr-fhandle extraction mode so that it does not generate errors
	(since the calls to this function are not wrapped in an error
	handler).  

	* nfs.cl: Changed with-non-stale-fh to with-valid-fh.  This new
	macro now checks for invalid file handles as well as stale
	handles.  An appropriate error code is returned to the client for
	each scenario (depending on NFS protocol version).

2005-06-21    <layer@HOBART>
4.0, rc4

	* nfs.cl: in with-nfs-err-handler, move illegal-filename-error
	  clause above file-error one
	* fhandle.cl: make illegal-filename-error a subclass of
	  file-error, so clients get a good error message and the errlog
	  file doesn't get a log of these types of errors.

2005-06-18    <layer@HOBART>
4.0, rc3

	* Makefile: allow version to include letters (ie, rc3)
	* nfs.cl: bind *print-structure* and *print-array* to nil so
	  errlog doesn't grow so fast.

2005-06-08    <layer@HOBART>
4.0, rc2

	* loadem.cl: turn off debugging stuff
	* Makefile: remove references to `ntservice' since it's now a
	  module in ACL

2005-06-06    <layer@HOBART>

	* attr.cl: remove debugging logit's
	* loadem.cl: turn on debugging

2005-06-06    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* openfile.cl: Added macro with-nfs-open-file which holds
	*open-file-cache-lock* for the duration of the body.  This should
	prevent the open file reaper from closing files that are still
	being processed.

	* nfs.cl: Changed all instances of get-open-file to
	with-nfs-open-file.

2005-06-01    <layer@HOBART>
4.0, rc1

	* nfs.cl: version 4.0

2005-06-01    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* nfs.cl: write3 procedure: honor stable-how parameter (via fsync).

	* nfs.cl: commit procedure: Actually do something now (via fsync).

	* nfs.cl: setattr3 procedure: Compare the guard time against
	pre-op-attrs-ctime instead of file-write-date.

	* nfs.cl: write3 procedure:  Compute the 'wrote' count correctly.
	
2005-06-01    <layer@HOBART>

	* loadem.cl: ntservice is a patch now, so it's not needed
	* main.cl: require :ntservice

2005-05-31    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* nfs.cl: access procedure: Don't return access bits that the
	client didn't ask for.  This upsets Solaris 7.

	* nfs.cl: pathconf procedure: Return file attributes the right
	way (post-op-attrs).

	* Makefile: Removed the hacks that were in place when the
	configuration program was built using a different version of lisp
	than the nfs server.

	* nfs.cl: Fixed bug in the 'fsinfo' call.  A piece of return
	information (rtmult) wasn't being added.
	
2005-04-28    <layer@HOBART>

	* loadem.cl: add :nfs-telnet-server and :nfs-profiling features to
	  aid in debugging
	* main.cl: #+nfs-debug -> #+nfs-telnet-server
	* nfs.cl: version printing is more verbose

2005-04-25    <layer@HOBART>

    version changed to 3.99, in anticipation of the 4.0 release

	* attr.cl: format -> logit
	* configure.cl: logging
	* dir.cl: format -> logit
	* loadem.cl:
	- "main" needs to be before "nfs"
	- added telnet module
	* main.cl:
	- format -> logit
	- start telnet server (in debug mode only)
	* mountd.cl: format -> logit
	* nfs-shared.cl: logging to file support
	* nfs.cl: format -> logit
	* nfs.nsi: remove old compressor comment
	* portmap.cl: format -> logit
	* sunrpc.cl: format -> logit
	* (NEW) telnet.cl: telnet server
	* xdr.cl: format -> logit

2005-04-08    <layer@HOBART>

	* loadem.cl: commented out :nfs-debug feature -- if defined it
	  will give a stack trace at the point of error
	* nfs.cl (define-nfs-proc): add code, under #+nfs-debug, that
	  gives a stack trace on error

2005-04-04    <Ahmon Dancy@GOBY>

	* openfile.cl/attr.cl: Changed some equal hash tables back to eq
	since bug14795/bug14692 are resolved.

	* fhandle.cl
	 * Define new error condition 'illegal-filename-error'
	 * (sanity-check-filename): Use new error condition for illegal
	filenames.

	* nfs.cl (xdr-sattr-to-struct-sattr): If any of mode, uid, gid, or
	size are #xffffffff, treat them at nil (unspecified).

	******

	* First commit for NFSv3 support.  Only notable non-NFSv3 specific
	changes noted here:

	* main.cl: Added 'debugmain' function for ease of starting up the
	server while developing/debugging.

	* portmap.cl: with-port-mapper-mapping now allows the 'vers'
	parameter to be a list.

	* xdr.cl: (Hopefully) performance optimizations.  Added xdr-hyper
	and xdr-unsigned-hyper support.  Increased *xdrdefaultsize* to
	1024.

	(LISPDIR): Changed to 6.2 lisp.

	(clean): Clean the configure subtree too.   Removed the real-clean

2003-12-15    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* Makefile:  Added rules for making demo distributions.  

	* loadem.cl: Make the program name "Allegro NFS Server demo" or
	"Allegro NFS Server".

2003-12-12    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* nfs.nsi: New installer script.

	* Makefile: Added instructions to build installer.

	read/write access.  This feature has been requested twice.
	
2003-11-06  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* Updated readme.txt to discuss proper use of *nfs-fw-uids*.
	
2003-07-03  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

2003-07-03    <dancy@CANDY2K>

	* mountd and nfsd can now use an existing portmapper instead of
	the built-in one.  This will help for people who have Microsoft's
	SFU installed.
	
2003-07-02    <Ahmon Dancy@GOBY>

	* nfs.cl: Added *nfs-set-mode-bits* variable and corresponding

	* nfs.cfg.sample:  New parameter *nfs-rw-uids*.

	* readme.txt: Added documentation about *nfs-rw-uids*.

	* util.cl: Fixed stupid signed/unsigned bug in the ULARGE_INTEGER

	diskfree function.  Also added :foreign-static-gc allocation type
	to ff:allocate-fobject calls.

	debugging.  

	* notes.txt: Clarifications

2003-05-10    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* mountd.cl: mountd-export: Return no group information for
	exported filesystems.  This means that the export is for
	"everyone".  This enhances interoperability with more picky
	clients.

2003-03-19    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* nfs.cl: Bumped version to 1.1.3.

	Added additional mappings to map-errno-to-nfs-error-code.

	* Makefile:  Updated to use cygwin zip.
	
2003-03-13  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	added.  Removed a big chunk of useless comments.  Added access
	checking.  

	* readme.txt: Made a new section for 'Execution' which explains
	how to install the NFS server as a service.  Added mention of
	*hosts-allow* and *hosts-deny* (the docs for these are in
	access-control.txt).

	* sunrpc.cl: Cosmetic changes.

	* nfs.cl:  Reformatted code in a few places and replaced some if's
	with if*'s.

	Added func remove-statcache to uncached information that becomes

1.0.35
	
	* mountd.cl: 
	*  Added debugging control variable *mountd-debug* for mountd

	used for anything other than this.

	* nfs.cl:
	*  Made some output debugging-mode only.
	*  nfs-setattr now checks the return status of (truncate-file).

	* portmap.cl:
	*  Added *portmap-debug* variable and wrapped some debugging

	* fixes.cl: require delete-directory patch for 5.0.1 and 6.0.
	* (NEW, from jkf) nfs.ico
	* loadem.cl: use new icon file in ACL 6.2; set program title, too

2001-09-06    <dancy@DANCY2K>

	* nfs.cl (nfsd-setattr): Changes and new functions to make sure
	file attributes are properly handled.

2001-09-05    <dancy@DANCY2K>

	* nfs.cl (update-stat-times-and-size): Added a keyword arg 'trunc'
	that can be used to set the new file size to a specific value.
	(nfsd-setattr): Make use of the new keyword are to
	update-stat-times-and-size when truncating a file.  (parent-dir):
	new function that computes the parent pathname of a pathname.
	Note that the parent of c:\ is c:\.  (nfsd-lookup): Make use of
	new parent-dir function when the 'filename' is "..".  This ensures
	that filehandles remain consistent.

2001-09-04    <dancy@DANCY2K>

	* mountd.cl (mountd-message-handler): Added checks to make sure
	the version of the mount protocol being requested is the one we
	support (version 1).  If not, let the client know so that it'll
	(hopefully) downgrade versions.  I copied this code from nfs.cl
	where I made the same change a short while ago.

	Also changed the big 'cond' to a 'case' statement.

2001-08-16    <dancy@DANCY2K>

	* nfs.cl (nfsd-rename):  Close the from file before trying to
	rename it.    Also, added a general error handler around
	rename-file.  Rename errors will return NFSERR_IO.

	* portmap.cl:  Don't print information for the callit function.  

2001-08-16    <layer@HOBART>

	* nfs.cl:  Added error catcher around make-directory call.

	* nfs.html: Added link to source code zip.

2001-08-14    <dancy@DANCY2K>

	* nfs.cl: Added fixes to allow *nfs-dircachereaptime* to be 0 (for
	debugging and experimentation.  

	Only call set-file-time on files that were open for writing.

2001-08-13  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* NOTES.txt: added file to store implementation notes and bugs.

	* makezip:  Script to collect relevant files for a source
	distribution.

2001-08-13  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	*  loadem.cl: parameterized the create-service function..  Added
	delete-service function.

	* readme.txt:  Added building instructions and additional notes.

2001-08-11    <Ahmon Dancy@GOBY>

	* nfs.cl: Added comment to *statcachereaptime* to indicate that it
	should be larger than *openfilereaptime*.  

	Added code to return an IO error for the symlink call.

	Made some stat slot accessor macro.  

	Removed some unused functions.

	Modernized the fsinfo handler.

	Updated the open file reaper so that it resets the file
	modification time on the file after closing it (since closing may
	update the modification time to a value we don't want).

	* util.cl:

	Added set-file-time function to adjust the modification/access
	time of a file. 

	* util.cl:  Added truncate-file function which uses foreign functions.  
	* removed extra.c, extra.cl, and Makefile.  No more C code.

2001-08-10    <layer@HOBART>

	* portmap.cl (portmap-callit): add declare to get rid of compiler
	warning
	* loadem.cl: load ntservice from ntservice/

2001-08-10  Kevin Layer  <layer@crikey>

	* nfs.cl: lower dircachereaptime; work around strange problem with
	spot's nfs (copying from spot to hobart); some debugging info

2001-08-10    <dancy@DANCY2K>

	* sunrpc.cl:  Added new function rpc-send-prog-mismatch to send
	PROG_MISMATCH RPC responses.

	* loadem.cl:  Many changes.  Mostly to support the use of the nfs
	server as an NT service.   Requires "service.fasl".

	The new way to build the program:
	:cl loadem
	(loadem)
	(main)  ;; changed from (startem)

	Moved config file reading into this file (out of nfs.cl).

	Added function (create-service) which will add the nfs server to
	the list of services in Windows.  Make sure you call (buildit) to
	build a standalone executable.   

	* mountd.cl:  Changed the formatting of some debugging output.  

	The default list of exports is now nil.

	* nfs.cl:  Now check for incorrect NFS version request and send
	back a PROG_MISMATCH RPC reply.

	* portmap.cl:  Don't use the program version when matching.  This
	is gross.. but it makes things work better with amd (but I'm
	trying to convince the maintainer of am-utils that there is a bug
	in amd).
	

2001-08-03    <dancy@DANCY2K>

	* loadem.cl: Added a (buildit) function to build an nfs
	executable.  Added a (main) function.

	* nfs.cl:  Minor change that turned out to be unnecessary
	regarding the initialization of *nfsdxdr*.

2001-07-11    <dancy@SUCK>

	* nfs.cl (nfsd-statfs):  Added check for stale file handle.

2001-07-04    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* fhandle.cl: Added function swap-fhandles which is used by the
	rename code.

	* nfs.cl: Added #+(version> 6 1) near calls to
	(set-socket-options) so that this code will continue to work in a
	6.0 Allegro CL.

	Removed a bunch of obsolete diropargs stuff.

	Try to catch bad pathnames earlier by adding check to
	add-filename-to-dirname.    Also changed a bunch of code that
	calls add-filename-to-dirname to check its result.

	Fixed nfsd-rename code.

2001-07-03    <dancy@SUCK>

	* nfs.cl: Moved some defparameters closer to the top of the file.
	Set the directory cache reap time parameter to 30 seconds.  This
	should help w/ 'rm -r' behavior.  Added a new parameter
	*socketbuffersize* which is used when creating the udp and tcp
	communications sockets.  It looks like the default receive buffer
	size for UDP packets was pretty small (somewhere around 8KB) so
	writes from high-performance operating systems such as Solaris
	would cause a lot of packets to be dropped... resulting in very
	slow performance.  

	Undo the addition of '.' and '..' to directories.  It doesn't
	appear to be necessary and it may have been causing problems.

	(add-direntries): Added error handler to handle weird directories
	like "c:\System Volume Information" on Windows 2000.  Also
	added/changed some debugging output.

	* sunrpc.cl: Added an error handler around
	mp:wait-for-input-available.  Apparently errors will occur here if
	a socket in the waitlist gets a connection refused message.  This
	new code will handle that situation.   

	Added (ignore-errors) around write-sequence and send-to calls.  If
	they fail, the client will try.

	* nfs.cl: Lowered *statcachereaptime* from 50000 to 5.  The 50000
	was for testing.   

	* portmap.cl:  Changed the main 'cond' into a 'case'.  Implemented
	portmpap-null.  Added portmap-callit.  It doesn't do
	anything... just prints out the parameters.   As far as I can
	tell, there is no reason to implement this right now.

	* sunrpc.cl:  Added a parameter *gather* that chooses between two
	behaviors when it comes to TCP traffic.  If *gather* is t, the
	packet size plus the packet data will be combined into a single
	buffer and sent all at once.  This requires copying the the packet
	data into a new buffer which may prove to be slow.  A potential
	advantage of this is that network overhead will be reduced since
	one packet will be sent instead of one small packet (4 bytes)
	followed by a larger one.  One definite advantage of this is that
	it allows packet analyzers (like tcpdump) to read the packet
	properly. 

	* xdr.cl:  Important bug fix in xdr-opaque-variable-from-stream.
	Opaque data is supposed to be blocked to a 4-byte boundary.  I
	wasn't doing that.  Non-linux clients got very upset by this.

2001-06-22    <dancy@SUCK>

	* nfs.cl: Use excl::filesys-delete-file instead of delete-file so
	that I can get errno information.

2001-06-20    <dancy@SUCK>

	* fhandle.cl: Removed the ensure-* functions.  Removed any unused
	functions.  Added some type declarations to possibly speed some
	operations up.  Changed one function to a macro.

	* mountd.cl: Updated the code to use with-successful-reply.
	Removed some calls to obsolete functions in fhandle.cl.

	* mpsocketfix.cl: Added #-(version>= 6 1) conditionals since this
	fix is in 6.1.

	* nfs.cl: Added some type declarations.  Added a check or two to
	make sure certain functions were being called w/ pathnames (not
	strings).  Removed some calls to obsolete functions in fhandle.cl.
	Removed some unused functions.

	* sunrpc.cl: Added a #-(version>= 6 1) conditional around the code
	that caused the EWOULDBLOCK in 6.0.

	* xdr.cl: Added a gang of type declarations.  Fixed the syntax
	error I had in defstruct that was making my attempts at type
	declarations useless.

	
2001-06-14    <dancy@SUCK>

	* nfs.cl: Remove extra debugging output.  Added extra error
	checking to nfsd-create.

	* loadem.cl: Added 'fixes' to the load/compile list.

	* nfs.cl: Zillions of changes for optimization.  Added in a
	blocksize hack to improve 'rm -r' behavior w/ linux clients.

	* xdr.cl: removed a debugging message..  did some minor
	optimizations.

2001-06-07    <dancy@SUCK>


	* nfs.cl: Changed a zillion calls from ff:fslot-value to
	ff:fslot-value-typed.  Added a function to update file mtime,
	atime, and filesize in the statcache (used for nfsd-write).
	Cleaned up nfsd-remove.  Cleaned up nfsd-write.  

	* xdr.cl:  Changed the way xdr-opaque-fixed/variable return things
	(during extraction).
	
	* mountd.cl (mountd-make-fhstatus): Specify the size of the xdr to
	speed things up.

	* loadem.cl (startem): Run (nfsd) as a separate process now.

	* fhandle.cl (opaque-fhandle-to-pathname): New function.  
	* Many many changes that hopefully will improve performance

2001-05-23    <dancy@SUCK>

	* nfs.cl:  nfsd-getattr:  Added check for stale file handle.
	Commented out some debugging lines.

	nfsd-read: Changed call to xdr-opaque-variable to be more
	efficient (no subseq).

	* xdr.cl: Changed xdr-opaque-variable to allow for efficient
	operation.   Added a function xdr-opaque-variable-from-stream
	which isn't used yet.

2001-05-23    <layer@HOBART>

	* nfs.cl (nfsd-write): handle case of fhandle-vec-to-pathname
	returning nil

2001-05-23    <dancy@SUCK>

	* nfs.cl:  Changed a debugging message

	* sunrpc.cl: Update send-successful-reply so that it doesn't call
	rpc-send-msg (which saves an xdr-xdr call).

	* xdr.cl: Added a 'pos' slot to the xdr structure to use to avoid
	subseq calls in xdr-advance.  Updated other code to use this new
	slot.  Probably introduced a buncha bugs.

2001-05-23    <layer@HOBART>

	* extra.cl: make warning go away
	* nfs.cl: fix nfsd-remove to handle permission denied

2001-05-23  Kevin Layer  <layer@crikey>

	* many files, CRLF conversion

2001-05-22    <dancy@DANCYSOFT>

	* fhandle.cl:  Make sure pathnames are always canonicalized before
	hashing.  Also, added a function for dumping the file handle hash
	table.

	* mountd.cl: added (in-package :user) and cvs Id

	* mpsocketfix.cl: added (in-package :user) and cvs Id

	* nfs.cl added (in-package :user) and cvs Id
	Added a function to make sure directory names end w/ a backslash.

	Increased debugging info for nfs-readdir.

	Removed readdir caching code.

	Increased debugging info for add-direntries and also attempted to
	add a workaround for what I believe is a bug in the Linux NFS v2
	client implementation w/ regard to readdir.

	* portmap.cl:  added (in-package :user) and cvs Id

	* sunrpc.cl: added (in-package :user) and cvs Id

	* utils.cl: added (in-package :user) and cvs Id
	added :strings-convert nil  to calls to def-foreign-call to remove
	warnings. 

	* xdr.cl: added (in-package :user) and cvs Id

	* nfs.cl: Send rpc PROC_UNAVAIL for procedures that we don't
	handle.  This will prevent nfs clients from wedging.

	* sunrpc.cl: Added rpc-send-proc-unavail function to send
	PROC_UNAVAIL responses.

	* Added .cvsignore

	* added nfs.txt which is the NFS V2 RFC.
