nlm: Test server restart notification (at least get to a place
     where a linux machine will notice and an hpux machine will
     notice.. and by notice I mean that I expect them to try to
     reestablish their locks (which won't work, but they should 
     try).
nlm: How long do we try sending NLM_GRANTED messages? Forever?

rpcgen: Generate client functions as well.  Use them in nlm.cl

nlm: Check all places in nfs.cl where close-open-file is called.  Make
 sure that they can't conflict with file locks (closing a file
 drops the locks)

Everywhere: Use memcpy in places where it is usable (like in xdr-opaque-fixed).

def-rpc-program-main (and other places like it):  Send a negative
response if an unrecognized procedure is called.
