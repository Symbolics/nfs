nlm: Test server restart notification.
nlm: How long do we try sending NLM_GRANTED messages? Forever?

rpcgen: Generate client functions as well.  Use them in nlm.cl

nlm: Check all places in nfs.cl where close-open-file is called.  Make
 sure that they can't conflict with file locks (closing a file
 drops the locks)

Everywhere: Use memcpy in places where it is usable (like in xdr-opaque-fixed).
