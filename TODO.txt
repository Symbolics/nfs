Finer grain locking on openfiles.  Need a lock for the hashes and
a lock for a given file.

Redo nsm.cl using rpcgen.

nlm: Look at Solaris 8 source to see how it handles cancel requests
(what parts of the request does it require exact matching on?).

nlm: Lock down most operations during grace period.
nlm: access controls.

nlm: Check all places in nfs.cl where close-open-file is called.  Make
 sure that they can't conflict with file locks (closing a file
 drops the locks)

Use memcpy in places where it is usable (like in xdr-opaque-fixed).
