Redo nsm.cl using rpcgen.

nlm: Lock down most operations during grace period.
nlm: access controls.
nlm: interface w/ nsm.  Find all places where we need to turn
     monitoring on (when a lock is obtained.. even if we have 
     not successfully notified, and when a lock is unlocked..
     for whatever reason.. look at calls to nlm-do-unlock)

nlm: How long do we try sending NLM_GRANTED messages? Forever?

nlm: Check all places in nfs.cl where close-open-file is called.  Make
 sure that they can't conflict with file locks (closing a file
 drops the locks)

Everywhere: Use memcpy in places where it is usable (like in xdr-opaque-fixed).
