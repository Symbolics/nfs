Find out why startup shortcut is not being created.
Find out how to prevent more than one instance of the console from
running (mutex?).

nsm: How long do we try sending state-change notifications?
nsm: How long do we try notify sending callbacks?
nlm: How long do we try sending NLM_GRANTED messages? Forever?

xdr and xdr users: Find all places where signed versus unsigned does
not matter and give preference to signed.  Really only need to look in
nfs.cl where performance is important.  It looks like I tended to use
xdr-int most of the time.  Verify that using xdr-int to store an
unsigned value doesn't present any problems (can't imagine why it
would.. but verify). nfs-xdr-fattr is probably a good candidate for
tweaking.

Possible feature: Add a mode where file handle information is
maintained on-disk (perhaps using allegrocache) so that the server can
be restarted without resulting in stale filehandles.  Clearly this
would have a performance impact, however, it's not clear yet how much
of an impact there would be.  The only times that it would impact are
when a haven't-seen-yet file is accessed or when a file is deleted.
The database will also grow indefinitely.  Some process to clean out
obsolete entries will be needed.

Related to the prior entry:  Just keep the export root file handles
stored on disk.  The on-disk file would only have to be updated when
exports are added or removed. This wouldn't prevent a stale file
handle situation for any files, but it would allow the primary mount
point to remain stable.  This might help some clients.
