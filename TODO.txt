Redo nsm.cl using rpcgen.

nlm: Lock down most operations during grace period.
nlm: access controls.
nlm: interface w/ nsm

nlm: Make a list of the problem scenarios that can occur when blocking
locks are being processed.  
 
  What should happen if a client retries a lock request while there is
  a pending retry?  This is something that is demonstrable with a
  linux client.  A reasonable solution would be to remove any matching
  entries in the retry list.

  What should happen if a cancel comes in while we're trying to make a
  GRANTED call to the client?  This is a definite race scenario.  The
  cancel should go through.

  When an unlock request comes in for a not-yet-dequeued retry lock
  (because the grant hasn't been acknowledged yet).. cancel it.

nlm: Check all places in nfs.cl where close-open-file is called.  Make
 sure that they can't conflict with file locks (closing a file
 drops the locks)

Use memcpy in places where it is usable (like in xdr-opaque-fixed).
