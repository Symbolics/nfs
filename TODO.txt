nsm: How long do we try sending state-change notifications?
nsm: How long do we try notify sending callbacks?
nlm: How long do we try sending NLM_GRANTED messages? Forever?

nlm: Check all places in nfs.cl where close-open-file is called.  Make
 sure that they can't conflict with file locks (closing a file
 drops the locks).

NSM: 'priv' data, when read back in from state file, is read in as a
simple-array t, rather than a usb8 array.  Need to convert it when
re-reading the state file.

Make sure that service startup/shutdown works.. and also via console
control.  Right now console control has a noticeable delay when a
close is requested.  Need to fix this.

xdr and xdr users: Find all places where signed versus unsigned does
not matter and give preference to signed.  Really only need to look in
nfs.cl where performance is important.  It looks like I tended to use
xdr-int most of the time.  Verify that using xdr-int to store an
unsigned value doesn't present any problems (can't imagine why it
would.. but verify). nfs-xdr-fattr is probably a good candidate for
tweaking.
