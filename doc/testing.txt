Correctness and performance testing are detailed here.

*******************************************************************************
** Correctness
*******************************************************************************

The types of correctness testing we do:
  * testnfs :: a C program that runs a set of tests against a server
  * write/read script test :: a script that writes a bunch of stuff,
    reads it back and compares it to the original

Future: once NFS is SMP capable, the stress tests should include
multiple clients

*********************
`testnfs' setup:

 * windows: thor:
   - sshd must be running
   - make a directory c:/tmp/nfs.test and put a copy of some large
     file there and call it `nfstestfile'
   - NFS share e:/nfs.test as `nfs.test'
 * linux: freon:
   - make sure /home/tmp/layer/nfs.test exists and put a copy of the
     same `nfstestfile' there (via some means other than NFS)
   - make `testnfs'

Run the test:

    $ ./testnfs -l /home/tmp/layer/nfs.test -t /c/tmp/nfs.test thor \
      		/net/thor/nfs.test

The above causes the NFS share to be mounted, so take care when making
changes on the Windows side.

*********************
`bigfile-test.sh' setup:

 * make sure `nfsdir' and `localdir' definitions are correct -- they
   should be on unbacked up partitions

Run the test:

    $ test/bigfile-test.sh

`ERROR' will be printed and the program will exit with a non-zero exit
status in the case of failure.

*********************
`stress-test.sh' setup:

 * make sure `nfsdir' and `localdir' definitions are correct -- they
   should be on unbacked up partitions

Run the test:

    $ test/stress-test.sh number-of-iterations

In the case of failure an error message should be printed.

One interation takes about 1m.  Running for a few hours is a good
idea, so something like 

    $ test/stress-test.sh 240

*******************************************************************************
** Performance
*******************************************************************************

Overview:
  `hammernfs' is used to test NFS performance.  Using the `nfstestfile'
  from the above, you can do

      $ ./hammernfs localhost:/nfs.test/nfstestfile

  The script test/performance.sh runs hammernfs in many different
  combinations of block size, NFS protocol version (2, 3) and transport
  layer (tcp, udp).

Setup:
   - make a directory, say e:/nfs.test, and put a copy of some large
     file there and call it `nfstestfile'
   - NFS share e:/nfs.test as `nfs.test'

First time:
  $ test/performance.sh test/performance.log.5.1.baseline
Second (and later) time:
  $ test/performance.sh test/performance.log.5.1
To see the results, run:
  $ /c/acl90/mlisp -L test/performance.cl
Make sure what files are in use in the call to `doit' at the end of
the test/performance.cl script.
