testnfs Usage:

Usage: ./testnfs [-skipread] [-skipwrite] nfshost host-temp-dir nfs-mounted-temp-dir

testnfs uses 'on' to connect to the NFS server to do some verifcations
of data transfer, so some of the command line parameters reflect that:

'nfshost' is the host to 'on' into.

'host-temp-dir' is the path to a temporary directory on
'nfshost'.. as it would be specified in the shell in the host.  

'nfs-mounted-temp-dir' is the unix path to the NFS-mounted temp dir
that corresponds to the 'host-temp-dir'.

Better explained by example:

ond on candyman is configured to use the cygwin shell.

/c/temp is a cygwin-acessible directory.

Allegro NFS is configure to export C:\ as '/warez', read-only to every,
read/write to dancy.

on unix host:  mount candy2k.win:/warez /mnt

So a command line like this might be used:

./testnfs candy2k.win /c/temp /mnt/temp

Use the -skipread and/or -skipwrite optional args can be used to skip
the read or write tests.. which can take a while (depending on the
size of the test file).

testnfs has some expectations.  It expects acl62.bz2 to be in /tmp on
the unix side.. and it expects the host temp dir to have acl62.bz2 as
well.  For proper testing, you shoul use something other than Allegro
NFS to get acl62.bz2 into the right locations on each machine.
