<h2>An NFS (v2) Server for Windows written in Allegro Common Lisp</h2>
<p><i>nfs</i> is an NFS server for Windows written in Allegro Common Lisp.&nbsp;
It was written by Ahmon Dancy of Franz Inc.&nbsp; The reason it was written was
our dissatisfaction with current products on the market, and the incredible
problems we had configuring them on Windows 2000.&nbsp; In fact, all told, we
spent about the same amount of time doing administration on the product we
bought as Ahmon did authoring the Lisp-based version--it took him about a week
to get it up, and another week to make it faster than the other version we had
been using.</p>
Enjoy.
